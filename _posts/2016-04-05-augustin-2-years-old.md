Today, my son, Augustin turned 2 years old. He's third in the set of four children I'm blessed with. When did _that_ happen, you say? Well... yeah. :)

Anyway, while I was pondering on what to do to celebrate his second year of life, it occurred to me that I can't even remember the last time I published something on my blog. In fact, I _do_ remember I had only two children at that time. And I _missed_ writing! So, both as a countermeasure and a celebration act, here it is! Packing a fresh (and much simpler) design with lots of stories to come.

So, expect me. I'll be buzzing! :)
